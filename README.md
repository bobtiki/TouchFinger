After Effects expressions for easy animation of touch highlights for iOS screencasts.

## Usage

Please see the included After Effects project file `TouchFinger for iOS Devices.aepx` for example comps using the expressions.

I recommend you use the device templates already set up in the project file, and use Brennan Chapmanâ€™s [True Comp Duplicator](https://aescripts.com/true-comp-duplicator/) to make a deep duplicate of all of the nested comps before editing them. Don't forget to check the "Update Expressions" checkbox before duplicating.
